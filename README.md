# Suits-
I am showing the relationsip between variables such as sexism, classism , men lawyers to women and married to non married 

The media I had chosen was Suits from netflix and it is based around lawyers and their everyday lives.  This variable represents quantitative values . 
It will measure how many women lawyers appear in season one of the show. The variables coding scheme will be to show the comparison between how many women 
lawyers there are to men lawyers throughout each of the seasons. This operationalizes the concept by showing comparison from the two sets of data that are going 
to be shown. I feel as this measure will be strong because the season shows a big part of the differences between men and women throughout the whole series. 
This concept represents qualitative values. I will measure this variable by explaining the different factors of the amount of stress a female lawyer may face. 
The variables coding schemes will be the different factors of stress such as paperwork, kids, and boyfriends, etc. This variable operationalized the concept by 
showing the amount of stress a female takes on rather than just going with the flow with everything. This measure I feel will be very strong due to the fact that 
it shows very vividly throughout the show. This variable represents the quantitative variables. I will measure this factor by showing the difference between the
male lawyers and females lawyers throughout the whole shoe. The variable coding scheme will be the amount of lawyers throughout the different amount of lawyers in 
each season of the show. This variable will operationalize the concept by showing the gender difference between men and female lawyers in today's society. 
This measure is strong because it is the key aspect to this part of the project.
